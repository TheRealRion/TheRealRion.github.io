 <!-- About Me section -->

 <div id="about"> 
  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p> Not sure who I wanted to be when I grew up, I joined the Air Force right out of high school. There, I fell in love, had a baby, and got married! We later added another kiddo and three cats to our family. 
    <br>
  My husband's job always leads us on grand adventures, moving us from the USA to England and on to Japan! Never one to sit still, I got my BA in business and Masters in Business Administration (MBA) along the way. 
  <br>
  <br>
  After my previous employer suffered from the ongoing global pandemic, I took the opportunity to pursue a life long goal of becoming a full-stack developer through LEARN Academy! 
  <br>
  <br>
  While I never know where my husband's career will move our family next, I know that there will always be my computer and internet! 
  </p>
  <br>
  <h4>Hobbies</h4>
  <p> After the birth of my first kiddo, I became a Labour and Postpartum Doula (non-medical birth assistant). I also took up knitting and collecting a deck of cards form every place we visit. </p>
